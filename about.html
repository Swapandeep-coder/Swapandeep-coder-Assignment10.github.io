            This website is a compilation of assignments completed during my Faculty Development Program (FDP).
            The program involved 9 different assignments, each focused on different digital tools, AI platforms, and teaching techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aim of creating this website is to showcase my learning journey and make the assignments accessible to others.
